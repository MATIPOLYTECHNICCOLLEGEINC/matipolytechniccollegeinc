Hi there ðŸ‘‹ It's Jeo.

This page is a learning project, built with the basic and most common languages in programming and web development, HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript functions.

The website was built and coded from scratch. As I understand the programming and the language I used, the page keeps its progress and new Integrated factions. 

MATI POLYTECHNIC COLLEGE, INC. is a premier private institute in the small developing Mati City in Davao Oriental, Philippines.

The school was unable and is currently struggling to keep up with the development of technology, particularly in this aspect. The institute needs expert help to leverage its market and purpose, to offer and high-quality education for both Junior High School, Senior High School, College up to the the Doctorate Degree.

With my curiosity and eagerness to learn programming even in a basic way, I lend my dedication to learn to help develop a basic page that can show off the school's Market. A platform that will serve as a point of reference for all exploring something new and looking for opportunities in terms of education.

This page is still improving and developing, please bare with us and please support.
