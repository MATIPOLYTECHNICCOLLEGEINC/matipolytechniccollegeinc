Hi there ðŸ‘‹ It's Jeo.

This page is a learning project, build with the basic and most common language in programing and web development, the HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript functions.

The website was build and coded from scratch. As I go deeper understanding about the programming and the language I used, the page keeps its progress and new Integrated factions. 

MATI POLYTECHNIC COLLEGE, INC. is a premier private institute in the small developing Mati City in Davao Oriental, Philippines.

The school was unable and is currently struggling to keep with the development of technology particularly in this aspect. The institute needs an expert help to leverage its market and purpose, to offer and high quality education for both Junior High School, Senior Hugh School, College up to the the Doctorate Degree.

With my curiosity and eagerness to learn programming even in the basic way, I lend my dedication to learn to help develop a basic page that can show off the school's Market. A platform that will serve as point of reference for all exploring something new and looking for opportunities in terms of education.

This page is still improving and developing.
