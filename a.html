                        Still noting an inadequacy in the educational demands of Davao Oriental youths, Mr. Agbong, the founder-president,
                        obtained clearance for the providing of four-year courses of the then department of education, culture, and sports (DECS).
                        Indeed, the institution was granted permission to offer the following bachelor's courses:<br>
                        Bachelor of Science in Criminology (July 9, 1997).<br>
                        <br>
                        Bachelor of Science in Commerce (October 16, 1997), and Bachelor of Elementary Education (November 25, 1997).
                        With these permits, the school was able to apply for a change of name from Mati Polytechnic Institute (MPI) 
                        to Mati Polytechnic College (MPC) and was given its final approval by the Securities <br>
                        and Exchange Commission last April 18, 2000.<br>
